        <p class="lead">
          The theme throughout my seven years of work across the public and private sector in food service, retail, manufacturing, education, and energy has always been development of programs, new business, and key relationships. As I return to my home state, I’m incredibly motivated to use my diverse experience to become part of the local community and make a difference in its future.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          A large part of my motivation to be part of Durham’s continued growth comes from being a North Carolinian. After living around the country and abroad, I know how much North Carolina has to offer and people from all over are starting to fully appreciate this. Durham in particular is a place that seems to walk the talk when it comes to innovation and inclusion. The startup culture mixed with a strong art and food scene and Research Triangle Park (RTP) gives Durham an incredible draw. The culture that makes Durham unique and enticing will only increase as Durham invests in partnerships across multiple sectors. There’s so much opportunity for sustainable growth, which is also a challenge for Durham of maintaining its roots while innovating. I understand that progress for Durham means helping the city maintain and attract businesses, which means investing in the people and communities that have made Durham the city it is.

            While development is my main mission, account management and customer service are an essential part of my day-to-day as well. For an artisanal bakery specializing in sourdough bread and traditional pastries made from scratch and delivered every day of the year, keeping customers happy is no small feat.

            <p class="lead">
              When I arrived the product had been delivered already. I immediately identified the accounts who received the product and prioritized key accounts based on sales volume, then created a script and divided priority accounts among our team. We called all accounts impacted within a few hours, adjusted invoices, sent emails to anyone we missed and coordinated the delivery of alternative product to those in need.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The team went back over this mishap and put better systems in place to avoid something of this scale happening again. When mistakes happen, you can win or lose a customer for life based on how you handle them.

            As a bakery sales manager, understanding our success depends on growth and comes down to sales numbers.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Our team measures our sales revenue and assesses performance weekly, monthly and year-over-year based on: the percentage change in sales, the percentage of sales from our top accounts, the number of accounts at multiple sales volume levels, the month-over-month projection vs. the actual, and the number of active accounts.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Our role is to transform raw data from our online ordering system into digestible themes in Google sheets to inform the bakery’s decisions on strategy and resources.  While this sounds simple, uncovering a story in the numbers to inform artistically inspired bakers is easier said than done.
